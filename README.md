See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Firebase configuration

Firebase config object has been left out on purpose, you may create and connect your own Firebase project to the app though!

Once you have the config object, place it into the [env](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html#environment-variables) file as a JSON object with the key `VUE_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG`.
